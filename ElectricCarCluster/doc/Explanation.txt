Explanation

> The application window should sized at 1920 x 720 px
Set the QML with fixed size and make it show as frameless window.

> The background should fill the entire application window (1920 * 720)
The background image is same size as the main windows, so nothing need to do.

> The gauge should be placed to the center of window
Using anchor.centerIn property

> The needle tip should touch the outer ring of the gauge
The height of needle image is same as the raduis of the gauge.
So make the needle image's Top position same as the Center position of gauge image.

> Text should be centered within the inner gauge ring
Using horizontalAlignment and verticalAlignment property

> Text should use the either one of the provided DejaVuSansMono fonts
Load the font file by QML FontLoader

> The needle movement needs to be animated
Export C++ QPropertyAnimation to QML, because it can control the direction of the animation.

> Needle changes its color from green to red when the rpm exceeds 6500 rpm.
When the program loaded, if the red needle does not exist, 
then it will be generated base on the green needle.
(But if possible I think to create the red needle using Photoshop shall be better)

> Speed should increase or decrease in relation to rpm
> When the application is started the indicated speed should be 0 km/h and rpm 0
> Implement a logic that for accelerating or decelerating based on key presses
So the gauge can be considered as a model having 3 functions, increase, decrease and stop.
And having a property like speed(rpm), max speed...
Then listen the Key and trigger the function.
The model makes GUI perform as
increase: Play(resume) animation forward
decrease: Play(resume) animation backward
stop: Stop animation
